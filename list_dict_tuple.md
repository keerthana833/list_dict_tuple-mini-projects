# LIST,DICT,TUPLE Mini projects
This repository is a collection of python ,mini-projects built using lists,dictionaries,and tuples.Each program is menu-driven and interactive,
designed to strengthen my fundamentals in python.These projects reflect my journey as a first-year mechanical engineering student exploring coding
and building a portfolio.

# Projects Included
-Contact Book: A simple program to add,view and delete contacts using dictionary logic.
-Student Management System: Allows adding students with Marks,Viewing all records and searching for a student by name.
-Library Book Management: Lists available Books,Checks availability,and handles book returns using nested dictionaries.

# How to Run
To Run any of these projects:
-Open the folder in your code editor(for example,VS code).
-Choose the project file you want to run,such as menudriven_contact_book.py.
-Open a terminal inside the folder and type: python menudriven_contact_book.py
-The program will start amd you can follow the menu options shown on the screen to interact with it.

# What I Learned
-How to use Lists,dictionaries and tuples to store and manage data.
-Building menu-driven programs with clear input and output flow.
-Practicing if-else logic for input validation and user interaction.
-Organizing projects into folders and pushing them to GitHub.
Troubleshooting Git errors and learning how to sync local code with remote repositories.

# Why this repo matters
This repo shows the small python projects I worked on while learning the basics.It keeps all my Projects programs in one place,so I can track my progress
and share them easily.Each file reflects how I applied lists,dictionaries and tuples to solve simple problems.
